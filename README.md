# Star_Citizen_Controller
Disclaimer: This is my first published project ever, so expect the worst and maybe you will be surprised (but I wouldn't count on it)
This is the repository of a 4-Axis Star Citizen Controller using a Raspberry pi and a Touchscreen as a Macropad

## Intro and credits
The work is based on a controller by [Tinker Player Solder Pi](https://www.youtube.com/@TinkerPlayerSolderPi) 
I used the footage of his controller as a loose guide:
[Custom space flight controller - first flight in Star Citizen] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e5ViENf0X4)
[How I built a custom joystick for Star Citizen] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTITm7ulwR4)
He also mentioned in one of the replies to the videos, that he was working on a [Version 2](https://imgur.com/a/custom-6dof-joystick-with-touchscreen-interface-NOEMydg)

As Arduino Library I used [Arduino Joystick Library 2.1.1](https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary) by [MHeironimus](https://github.com/MHeironimus)
The icons have been designed by [KorneliusVonTastik] and can be downloaded here [https://ko-fi.com/kvtkorp](https://ko-fi.com/kvtkorp) -see [Original Reddit Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/1dvfeq6/icon_pack_and_streamdeck_profiles_by_kvt_korp/). Buy him a coffee or two. The Icons will not be included in this repository.
